Our technology

Our web application is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.

We utilize a growing amount of React on the front end to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.

We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.

We do most of our planning and collaboration in Aha! Roadmaps and built Aha! Develop so that software engineers and their teams could take advantage of those same rich features. We use Slack and Zoom for video calls. (Email? Rarely.)

Your Experience

Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so you should have experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.

Skills

We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. You have strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. You are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others. You want teammates who enjoy solving problems regardless of the technologies and techniques involved. You have worked at meaningful scale before and want to do so again.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Volunteer Virtual Classroom Speaker (Career Day - Music)

Description

Students will be spending the school day going to 3 presentations on various careers, presented by career professionals. The purpose of this session is for students to gain exposure and learn about careers that interest them. Each session should aim to highlight the importance and relevance of this career path and provide students additional background knowledge. It should also include fun facts and visuals!

Key Questions

What is your job? What do you do at your job? How did you get to that job/ position? Did you have to do postsecondary education? Do you have an example of any projects/ responsibilities you have done in your role? If applicable, could you give a demonstration of what you do? If comfortable, please share the average annual salary of your job. If you did something before this current job/ position, how/ why did you choose to change? What are some soft skills that you use in your job? What are some of the hard skills that you use in your job? If a student were interested in going into this career, what would your advice to them be?

Expected Outcomes

Students need help understanding connections between high school and postsecondary opportunities. I want them to learn that you can make a career out of your own interests and hobbies, things that you’re good at, or just working at something that serves the lifestyle they are interested in.

 Students could use insight into what it’s like leaving high school and deciding what to do with their lives. It’s beneficial for them to learn from adults that it may not always be easy. Please speak some on how you decided what you would do after high school and what your journey looked like on your way to where you are now.

 I’m hoping for about a 25 minute presentation on the career, allowing for about 5 minutes of questions with the students. Please be as engaging/ interactive as possible. The audience is middle school students who are eager to learn about a possible career they would like to pursue. The teacher in the classroom will provide management of the students and can help facilitate the question portion.

About our Company
There is no pill or procedure that completely solves the effects of chronic inflammation. Addressing the issues that cause chronic systemic inflammation—isolation, chronic stress, poor dietary choices, physical inactivity, disrupted sleep, and others requires drawing on the building blocks of good health: sleep, whole food, social support, and activity. These are the keys to remedy inflammation and chronic disease. 
As powerful as it is, lifestyle change is also famously difficult to implement and sustain. To address these challenges, we support participants through regular reflection on their health and lifestyle, enabling self-directed behavior change.
We are building an AI-powered social platform that enables the adoption and complex contagion of social norms to make it easier to change how we live. Our platform connects participants to each other, and helps them find within themselves, new and simple health ideas they can adopt, inspiring a journey of pragmatic reflection, self-discovery, and improvement. Ideas are initiated by community members or discovered through self-reflection and include topics across all of life’s experiences. Through our platform, we help people use their own agency to change who they are — their identity — and to increase their ability to actively change behavior, happiness, resilience, and health.
