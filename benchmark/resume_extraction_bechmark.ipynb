I was a visionary in regards to technical business operations, responsible for providing professional staff at various locations with efficient, up-to-date, secure and stable voice and data communications on a daily basis within budget.  The ability to use good judgment, proven technologies and industry standards to balance ease of use with security.  I am a fast paced leader with the patience to oversee the maintenance of existing systems while at the same time plan the implementation of new technologies in a cost efficient and timely manner.  I am both a professional team leader and player that has directly managed a staff of seven information technical professionals as well as participating in many project implementation teams and initiatives.  I am experienced in many of the technical methods, tools and applications used in business operations with the ability to connect multiple offices with highly secure and redundant Internet connections.  While at the firm I was able to receive better than competitive pricing for the circuits due to the quantity of services required as well as my vendor negotiation skills.  I have the technical knowledge and experience required for the strategic planning and funding of annual and multi-year business operations.  My efforts have resulted in a direct costs savings in business operations.  Most recently, we implemented user provided smart phones and free apps to provide efficient digital dictation and provided mobile capability to access our document management system.  I have a dedicated work ethic that is required to oversee day-to-day technical business operations updating and upgrading systems in use while at the same time implementing new systems: Upgraded the firms bread-n-butter time and billing financial system several times.  Upgraded the Word Perfect Application Suite to the Microsoft Office 2000 Suite.  Upgraded Microsoft Office 2000 Suite to the Microsoft Office 2007 Suite.  Upgraded the GroupWise Messaging to Outlook Messaging.  Upgraded the Worldox document management system to Worldox GX3.  Upgraded the Audix voice messaging to Mutare voice messaging.

I was the firm\\'s Security Officer and developed the technical security systems and procedures used in business operations.  It was an interesting responsibility due to the challenges with balancing \"ease of use\" while ensuring system and data \"security.\" Every year my team and I would oversee a mandatory HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) Program Review.  Every other year my team and I would facilitate a system wide vulnerability audit that included social engineering and vulnerability testing techniques.  I am an experienced project manager with the skill set, knowledge and interpersonal tools required to ensure the timely and efficient implementation of systems and applications.

A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter. There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek. Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!). Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).

Regular contacts include employees in the same or related units, employees and managers within IRS and contractors/vendors at several levels of the agency (campuses, headquarters or field offices); and individuals or groups from outside the agency, including consultants, contractors, vendors, or representatives of professional.  My main duties are to maintain server's operation, security, and analyze and diagnose system hardware and software components.  I also write up problem tickets with server's hardware and software and get clearance for vendors to have access to the servers for hardware repair as well as scheduling times with local I.R.S.  personal and vendor to accomplish the repairs.  I  make sure when new server are to be put on the Domain I do all of the appropriate paper work which includes requesting  UWR's, KISAM asset management to include all of the new servers information from serial numbers, bar code, make, model and location just to name few of them.  I also file out the Server Compliance checklist, software license forms.  In addition, I image or re-image server with the proper Windows Operating System and software needed to run the server e.g.  Contact Recording, Contact Analytics, TOS, RTS among other servers.  I also monitor and respond to KISAM Tickets I also monitor HIDS, Symantec Anti-Virus programs are up to date and operational.  Insure all Microsoft Windows patches are installed on servers.  I make sure Altiris is installed and the endpoint is healthy and if not I make the necessary corrections.  I run Windows Policy Checker to insure the server stays with IRS and Cyber Security Compliance.  If there are any that is not in compliance, I make the necessary changes to bring them back into compliance.  I create documents in Word and Power Point in referencing to problems that I have encountered during trouble shooting a situation for other's in my group in case they have similar situations or problems and put them in our group shared location on the network for all to read.  I also have done short training on things that I have encountered or I had more knowledge than others in my group via OSC in sharing on my conference calls.  TPF Operations Server (TOS) I am the main system administrator and my accomplishments that I achieved was to set up a single sign on BAG group, single sign on to the IMM, from un-secure  IMM Web page to a secure Web page and brought it current with the Big Fix patching.  Installing and maintaining software and hardware, controlling current versions in use and future release of application software, and documenting the physical configuration of the system.  Optimizing the functionality of servers systems using performance tuning tools and techniques.  Analyze and Diagnosing and recovering failed systems using systems diagnosis tools and fault identification techniques.  Planning and coordinating the installation of new products or equipment, resolving installation problems, identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities and risks, and maintaining server integrity and availability.  Initiating corrective or preventive actions, such as increasing disk or memory capacity to improve system performance.\"}, {'name': 'Company Name', 'role': 'Information Technology Computer System Administrator', 'from_date': '01/1989', 'to_date': '04/2007', 'location': 'Ogden, UT 84201', 'description': \"Series:2210 Pay Plan: GS Grade:  Information Technology Computer System Administrator (This is a federal job) Supervisor Sandy Spiers (801-620-4555) May Contact Supervisor: Yes.  My responsibilities were to assist public electronic filing programmers by analyzing, diagnosing and making proposals on error in software to getting there software to passing the IRS standards for electronic filing.  I did this by using IRS IRM and thereby have them transmit standard test returns then I would have to print out there transmitted test returns and analyses and determine where there programming error's  were and call them and  communicate to them where the error occurred.  They would make the correction and it would be accepted as an Electronic Filing Software Program.  I also work closely with the electronic filing Tax Examiners in assisting the transmitters in problem solving their situation.  Another responsibility I had was to have all of the data copied to a nine-track tape and processed on the mainframe computer from that output then we had to drain the information on to an archival system that allowed the authorized I.R.S  employees to access the returns if a taxpayer had questions about their returns.  I also helped my group to maintain our network and desktop computers.  There were times we would lose connection to the network and we would have to use a network sniffer that would assist us on the type and location of the problem that needed to be fixed.  I also would install updates to the workstations, as they became available to us thru download transmittal.  Job Related Training:.\"}]\n"

Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters. A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume. Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch. A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression. Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter. There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek. Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!). Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest). The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position. Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty. Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.\",\n",
